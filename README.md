### General:
- Utilizing the LLaMA 3 free API (available at ***[this link](https://console.groq.com/)***).
- To address the limitations of LLMs in general and LLaMA in particular, I have enhanced the information update process by incorporating RAG.
  
### Retrieval Information:
- Employing the News API to retrieve news related to the query (available at ***[this link](https://newsapi.org/)***).
- Using BERT to encode text into embeddings and then using Faiss to store and retrieve vectors quickly.

### Generation:
- Selecting the K-best articles to assist LLMs in generating accurate answers to questions.
  
### Results achieved:
- Llama 3 is now able to answer questions about recent issues, such as the results of the 2024 Olympics.

### Next improvement focus:
- Developing a fully functional chat box that can remember chat history and respond to questions related to previous conversations.
